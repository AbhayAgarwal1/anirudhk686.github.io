I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student, pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science along with Msc. in Economics. I am a dual degree student at Birla Institute Technology and Science, Pilani, which is a top ranked private university in India.

From childhood i was always astoned by _Nature and its creations_. I always wondered about the beginning of universe and birth of intelligence. I wondered about how babies who knew only to cry go on to think and comprehend things like _relativity_. I have been since then passionate to _decipher_ the nature's most ingenious creation _"the brain"_. 

> **_" Solve intelligence, use it to solve everything else "_** <br>
>  _-  Demis Hassabis, CEO, Deepmind_<br>

This quote rekindled my childhood dreams which made me choose Computer Science as my major. I wanted to learn and build machines that emulate brain. From the day i listened to Demis's talk , I have been learning about how humans have approached to solve this mystery of nature. I ventured into deep learning an year ago and believe it to be the key to unlock the mind. I am extremely passionate learning about _CNN ,RNN ,and Reinforcement learning_. The generality of these techniques is what that impresses me the most.

I aspire to be a part of this great quest of mankind to solve intelligence and use it to serve humanity.
