## Facial recognition system using convolutional neural network <br>(_July 2017_)
* This project was part of my research internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India. 
* I have used the VGG-16 Net architecture and this has been implemented using keras library in python.
* Implementation done based on the approach suggested in this [paper](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf).
* Detailed note of methodology followed is presented in the [**_Project blog_**](https://anirudhk686.github.io/facial_recognition/).

## Antarctic weather data analysis using ARIMA model <br>(_June 2017_)
* This project was part of my research internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India.
* After priliminary analysis, modeled temperature data with the Seasonal ARIMA model. Futher forecast was also done based on the obtained model.
* Wind speed analysis was also done. Here main objective was to find out the monthly blizzard distribution.
* Detailed note of methodology followed is described in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/anirudhk686/weather_data_analysis/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).
