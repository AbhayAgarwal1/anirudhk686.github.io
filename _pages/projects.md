## Facial recognition system using convolutional neural network (_July 2017_)
* This project was part of my research internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India. 
* I have used the VGG-16 Net architecture and this has been implemented using keras library in python.
* Implementation done based on the approach suggested in this [paper](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf).
* Detailed note of methodology followed is presented in the [**_project blog_**](https://anirudhk686.github.io/facial_recognition/).
